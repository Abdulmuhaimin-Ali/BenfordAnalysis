Benford Analysis Project
The Benford Analysis project provides a tool for conducting Benford's Law analysis on numerical datasets. Benford's Law, also known as the First-Digit Law, states that in many naturally occurring sets of numerical data, the leading significant digit is likely to be small. Specifically, it predicts the frequency distribution of digits in many real-life sources of data, such as financial statements, population numbers, and scientific data.
Usage
This project can be run by either entering numbers separated by spaces as input or by adding a file as an argument on the command prompt. The program then performs Benford's Law analysis on the provided dataset.
Calculation Formulas
Benford's Law predicts the expected distribution of leading digits based on the logarithmic distribution:
P(d)=log10(d+1)−log10(d)
Where:
•	P(d) is the probability of leading digit d.
•	log10log10 denotes the base-10 logarithm.

Digit	Benford's Law (%)
1	30.1
2	17.6
3	12.5
4	9.7
5	7.9
6	6.7
7	5.8
8	5.1
9	4.6

The table above presents the expected percentages of leading digits according to Benford's Law.
Analysis Results
After performing the analysis, the program generates a detailed report including:
•	Observed frequencies of leading digits in the dataset.
•	Mean, mode, and frequency of each digit.
•	Standard deviation of the dataset.
•	Comparison of observed frequencies with expected frequencies based on Benford's Law.
•	Assessment of whether the dataset conforms to Benford's Law.
•	Visualization showing the percentage of occurrence for each digit.
This comprehensive report provides users with valuable insights into the integrity and reliability of numerical datasets, aiding in the identification of potential anomalies or irregularities that require further investigation.
